# COMP47500 Advanced Data Structures in Java
# Bucket and Radix Sort

This project utilises the List Interface and the ArrayList Data Structure to implement Bucket Sorting for single
digits and Radix Sorting for lists of integers and characters (strings)

There are also methods present to test each of the three implementations and print the results to the screen.
